This is the repository for the [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) courses. In the first course, we build a computer from scratch using only NAND gates. 

Part 1 of the course covers the following topics:

- Boolean Logic and Boolean Arithmetic
- Logic Gates
- [Hardware Description Language (HDL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language)
- Hardware Simulation
- Multi-bit Buses

Projects:

1. In Project 1, we build the basic logic gates. We use the course's HDL to describe the gates and simulate them. The gates are:

- Nand (given)
- Not
- And
- Or
- Xor
- Mux
- DMux
- Not16
- And16
- Or16
- Mux16
- Or8Way
- Mux4Way16
- Mux8Way16
- DMux4Way
- DMux8Way
