In this famous course (often regarded as one of the best courses ever designed for Computer Science), we build a computer
from scratch, and then, using a higher-level programming language that we design ourselves, develop a program that runs on
that very computer.

This means that we go through all the building blocks a modern computer needs to be able to run software. In Part I we design
the hardware, and in Part II we focus on the software.

Part I consists of five projects:

1. Boolean functions and gate logic: we design our own basic chips, using the course's HDL (Hardware Descriptive Language), e.g.
   And, Not, Or, Xor, Mux, Dmux, etc.
2. Boolean Arithmetic and the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)
3. etc.
