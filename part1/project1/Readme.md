This is the repository for the [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) course. In this course, we build a computer from scratch using only NAND gates. Part 1 of the course covers the following topics:

- Boolean Logic
- Boolean Arithmetic
- Sequential Logic
- Machine Language
- Computer Architecture
- Assembler
- VM I: Stack Arithmetic
- VM II: Program Control
- High-Level Language
- Compiler I: Syntax Analysis
- Compiler II: Code Generation
- Operating System
- Database Systems

In this repository, you will find the HDL files for the projects in the course. The HDL files are written in the [HDL language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language).

Part 2 of the course covers the following topics:

- Computer Architecture
- Arithmetic Logic Unit
- Data Path
- Control Unit
- The Hack Computer
- The Hack Computer: The Operating System
- The Hack Computer: The Operating System: The Compiler
- The Hack Computer: The Operating System: The Operating System
- The Hack Computer: The Operating System: The Operating System: The Operating System

But we will get to that later.
